    <p style="font-size: large; padding: 0px 50px 50px 50px; line-height: 150%;">We encounter problems in our everyday lives, all around us, all the time. Many of these problems can be solved using science, <span class="blank">blank</span>, engineering and math. Before we can find a <span class="blank">blank</span> to any problem, it is very important that we carefully understand the problem <em><strong>blank</strong></em>  with enough <span class="blank">blank</span>. In addition to precise criteria, we also need to understand the our design <span class="blank">blank</span>, which might be financial limits, physical boundaries, or important considerations about the legal or social consequences of certain choices. A <span class="blank">blank</span> solution to a problem has considered both the problem criteria and the design constraints.</p>
