    <h2>Planet Profiles Revisited</h2>
      
      <p>In week 4 we <a href="http://bsfstemscholars.com/stem-scholars-interns/our-intergalactic-trip-to-the-adler/">visited the Adler Planetarium</a> and learned about the different planets from the Solar System gallery in the museum. We used what we learned to build <a href="https://minigroup.com/posts/394504">these planet profiles</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Return to the <a href="https://minigroup.com/posts/394504">planet profiles you made in Week 4</a> and correct your work here. Change the Earth information below for your planet.</strong></p>
      
      <!-- Here you will need to replace text inside the cells <td></td> of a <table></table>. Replace the words "state your definition here" and other instructions below with your own definition of the terms criteria, constraint and solution.-->

    <h3>Planet Fact Sheet</h3>

      <p>Provide a brief description of this planet. Include any information about current <span class="ans">exploration, discoveries, or observed changes</span> to the planet itself.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Important Hint:</strong> <em>To calculate the mass, size, or distance of your planet in "Earths", you need to divide the mass, size or distance of your planet by the Earth's.</em></p>

      <h4>Step 0: Login and See Inside</h4>
      <p>Click on the image above to play the game. Then login using the stemscholar-bsf account and the usual password.</p>
      
      <center><img id="tutorial" src="https://346caac6a1c349ef3bd5db6b1951e02ae1c1c73f.googledrive.com/host/0B70TnPncvpGuUXFYLVNJZkkxTWs/planetquiz00a.png">

        <p>You'll notice that this one is a little more complex than some of the other projects we've worked on, but don't worry. We'll takit one step at a time.</p></center>

      <center><img id="tutorial" src="https://346caac6a1c349ef3bd5db6b1951e02ae1c1c73f.googledrive.com/host/0B70TnPncvpGuUXFYLVNJZkkxTWs/planetquiz00c.png">

      <h4>Step 1: Backdrop and Title</h4>
      <p></p>
      
      <p>The first thing you will want to do is change the backdrop and title! Afterall, your planet is super cool and we want to make sure people see it. Then we want to change the title "Planet Quiz" to replace the word "planet" with your planet's name. That way people know what this is about.</p>
      
      <center><img id="tutorial" src="https://346caac6a1c349ef3bd5db6b1951e02ae1c1c73f.googledrive.com/host/0B70TnPncvpGuUXFYLVNJZkkxTWs/planetquiz01a.png">
        <p>First, find the backdrop thumbnail list just to the left of the Sprites. There is only one option in this quiz, "the Stage". Click it to switch the editor window to work on this backdrop.</p></center>
      
      <center><img id="tutorial" src="https://346caac6a1c349ef3bd5db6b1951e02ae1c1c73f.googledrive.com/host/0B70TnPncvpGuUXFYLVNJZkkxTWs/planetquiz01b.png">
        <p>In the main editor window on the right, find the "Backdrops" tab at the top, to the right of the "Scripts" tab. Click it to open up the backdrop editor specifically. Here you can upload new images and edit them using the editing tools to paint, add shapes, or add text. Use Google image search to find an image of your planet you would like to uplaod. Make sure to edit both backdrops!</p></center>

      <h4>Step 2: Quiz Text</h4>
      <p>This Planet Quiz is about your planet, so let's make that super clear. Find the word "planet" throughout the code and replace it with the name of your planet. That way people playing the game will know what data to use!</p>

      <center><img id="tutorial" src="https://346caac6a1c349ef3bd5db6b1951e02ae1c1c73f.googledrive.com/host/0B70TnPncvpGuUXFYLVNJZkkxTWs/planetquiz02a.png">

        <p>In each of the examples above, the word "planet" is used and needs to be replaced with your planet's name! Find all of the places where you need to replace the word planet with your planet's name.</p></center>
      
      <center><img id="tutorialsm" src="https://346caac6a1c349ef3bd5db6b1951e02ae1c1c73f.googledrive.com/host/0B70TnPncvpGuUXFYLVNJZkkxTWs/planetquiz02e.png"> <img id="tutorialsm" src="https://346caac6a1c349ef3bd5db6b1951e02ae1c1c73f.googledrive.com/host/0B70TnPncvpGuUXFYLVNJZkkxTWs/planetquiz02f.png">      
        <p>Some of the text in this quiz is stored in a hidden place – a data structure called a "list", which looks exactly like what it sounds. To make the different lists in the code visible, click on the "Data" code block menu, scroll down through the data block options to find the lists, and click on the checkbox to the left of "Questions" to activate that list and make it appear in the demo screen (below).</p></center>
      
      <center><img id="tutorial" src="https://346caac6a1c349ef3bd5db6b1951e02ae1c1c73f.googledrive.com/host/0B70TnPncvpGuUXFYLVNJZkkxTWs/planetquiz02g.png">      
        <p>You can change the list items by clicking right into the orange lines. You can add new items by clicking the "+" button. Be careful before you add new list items, it can have a major impact on the code.</p></center>
      
      
      <a id="step3"></a>
      <hr>
      <h4>Step 3: Planet Data</h4>
      <p>Based on Step 2, you now know how to change other list data to make all the questions, answers and helpful information correct for your planet. Find the "Answers" and "Planet Data" lists and replace the values and information you find there with the correct values for your planet. The "Parameters" list will tell you what each item 1-3 is. </p>

      <a id="step4"></a>

      <h4>Step 4: Adding Questions</h4>
      <p>After Steps 2 and 3, you should be a pro at working with lists. So, I'm sure you could figure out how to add a question pretty easily.</p>
      
      <a id="step5"></a>

      <h4>Step 5: Posting it Here</h4>
