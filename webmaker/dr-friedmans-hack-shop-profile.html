        <h2>About Me and My Favorite Parts of HackShop</h2>      

        <p>I am an employee of <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, where I work as the Portfolio Strategist for the <a href="http://hivechicago.org/">Hive Chicago Learning Network</a>. I graduated from Rutgers University in NJ with a B.S. in Physics and I earned my Ph.D. in Astrophysics from the University of Chicago. My last job was at the Adler Planetarium where I worked to develop a STEM program for teens and worked alongside Ms. Nemeth. You can learn more about my professional experience on <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/robertbryanfriedman">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
        
        <p>When I am not working to transform the learning landscape of Chicago, my favorite things to do are spend time with my wife and my dogs (I have a minature Schanuzer and a terrier mutt), cook nice meals, read tons of comic books (I'm really into the Jason Aaron Thor series), and build, fix and ride bikes (I have three of them).</p>
        
        <p>My favorite part of <a href="http://bsfstemscholars.com/8th-grade">HackShop</a> is learning new things along with my students. Believe it or not, I actually didn't know how to do most of the projects that we do together before I started teaching this class in the fall of 2013. When I think of a lesson or an activity, I like it to be something that also teaches me a new skill. The best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else.</p>

This can be anything, like solving certain kinds of crimes, designing new types of machines, building better homes, cleaning up the environment, etc. Try to be as specific as possible, so instead of "I want to cure cancer", you might say "I want to help people with brain tumors recover more quickly after surgery."  -->

        <h4>The Problem I want to Solve Is This</h4>
        <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>

        <h4>The Criteria of a Good Solution</h4>
        <p>As you wish. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
           
        <h4>The Constraints of this Solution</h4>
        <p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>

        <p>When I teach students about solving problems and the criteria and constraints of a solution, I like to use <a href="https://rfriedmanbsf.makes.org/thimble/LTY5Njg0NDAzMg==/defining-problems-worksheet-your-names">Phonebloks as an example</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>

        <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. What?! I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</p>
